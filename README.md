Hello to those who are looking at autoexec's for CSGO on GitHub.

My ingame name is Butthur7 and this is my autoexec.
If you like me, spend time looking for autoexec inspiration on this platform, this might help you in a direction.

This autoexec is made specifically for my playstyle, and also my 4:3 stretched resolution.
If you are playing on other resolution ratios, please look into changing the HUD element sizing, and most importantly, look into sound settings.
The sound settings are optimised for 4:3 Stretched, and if you use it with 5:4, 16:9 or 16:10, the sound information will be skewed and will most likely annoy the heck out of you.


I hope you find something usefull or a bit of inspiration while looking through it.

Best of wishes,
Butthur7.
