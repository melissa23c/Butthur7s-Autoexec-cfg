Hello to those who are looking at autoexec's for CSGO on GitHub.

My ingame name is Butthur7 and this is my autoexec.
If you like me, spend time looking for autoexec inspiration on this platform, this might help you in a direction.

This autoexec is made specifically for my playstyle, and also my 4:3 stretched resolution.
If you are playing on other resolution ratios, please look into changing the HUD sizing, and most importantly, look into sound settings.
The sound settings are optimised for 4:3 Stretched, and if you use it with 5:4, 16:9 or 16:10, the sound information will be skewed and will most likely annoy the heck out of you.

If you don't know what the commands do, i suggest that you check by /r/CounterStrikeBinds/, it's a good community for getting help with setting up and adjusting your autoexec.
And you will also find very precise guides and informative posts that go in depth with the different commands, binds, and more.

I hope you find something usefull or a bit of inspiration while looking through it.

Best of wishes,
Butthur7.
